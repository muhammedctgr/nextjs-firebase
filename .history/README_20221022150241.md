## Overview

In this project, we demonstrated how to build a full-stack app with Next.js and Cloud Firestore. We covered how to set up Firebaseâ€™s Cloud Firestore and how to communicate with this database through a Next.js application.

We discussed how to create API endpoints and use those endpoints inside various components. We also demonstrated dynamic routing and server-side rendering for static page generation and explained how to dynamically regenerate existing or non-existing static pages.
